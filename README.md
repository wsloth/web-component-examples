# web-component-examples

This repo contains a bunch of snippets and examples of web components
using different frontend libraries.

## Generating screenshots

Using [Carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh/), you can create beautiful
screenshots of the snippets and save them as a PNG. The
`carbon-config.json` can be loaded into the application to make
consistent screenshots with the same settings as all others.
